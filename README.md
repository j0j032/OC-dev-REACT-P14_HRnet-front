### Description:

Hrnet is an app to manage your employees, it provides a simple interface to add, edit, delete and search
employees.
You can access to the app with the 2 differents users I've provided in the OC deliverables.

The interface display a list of employees in terms of its company. so you have custom theme for each company and
employees are different.

To test performance, I provide a no auth branch, it's the same app but without authentication. So if you want to test in
lightHouse
please check out to the [no-auth](https://github.com/j0j032/OC-dev-REACT-P14_HRnet-front/tree/no-auth) branch and run:

- ```pnpm run build```
- ```pnpm run preview```
